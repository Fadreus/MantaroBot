# Mantaro's Code of Conduct

1. Don't be mean. That's it. Be civil to everyone, and try to be as nice as you can.
2. Avoid bringing politics into talk here. We know OSS can get political, but this is a Discord bot, for hecks sake.
3. We won't change this code of conduct for another one. Most of the wording on them can be twisted too much. Being nice is enough. People should know how to respect each other. I hope.
